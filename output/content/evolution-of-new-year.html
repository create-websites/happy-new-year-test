    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a single-page, scrollable narrative. It begins with a hero section to set the context, followed by an interactive horizontal timeline as the primary navigation. Clicking a timeline event scrolls the user to a detailed content card for that era. This is more engaging than a simple text document. Subsequent sections are thematic: one focuses on the pivotal Gregorian calendar reform, another on global traditions via an interactive card grid, and a final section on modern celebrations with a data visualization. This structure was chosen to guide the user through a historical and cultural journey, allowing them to explore chronologically or jump to themes of interest, maximizing engagement and comprehension. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1. Historical Eras -> Goal: Organize/Change -> Viz: Interactive Timeline (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click to scroll to content -> Justification: Provides a clear chronological map and user-controlled navigation through history.
        2. Calendar Reform -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Side-by-side text blocks -> Interaction: Static display for clarity -> Justification: A direct comparison is the clearest way to explain the key differences between the Julian and Gregorian systems.
        3. Global Traditions -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: Interactive Card Grid (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click card to reveal details -> Justification: Organizes diverse information cleanly, preventing cognitive overload and encouraging discovery.
        4. Modern Resolutions -> Goal: Inform/Engage -> Viz: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Hover for tooltips -> Justification: Presents relatable modern data visually, adding a contemporary angle to the historical narrative. -->

Their festival, Akitu, was a 12-day religious event celebrated in mid-March, coinciding with the vernal equinox. It was a time to crown a new king or reaffirm loyalty to the reigning king, and it was believed that the gods decided the fate of the country for the coming year during this festival.' },

In 46 B.C., Emperor Julius Caesar implemented the Julian calendar, establishing January 1 as the first day of the year. January was named after Janus, the Roman god of beginnings and transitions, who had two faces—one looking to the past and one to the future. Romans celebrated by offering sacrifices to Janus and exchanging good wishes.' },

January 1 was frowned upon as the start of the year. For a time, December 25 (the birth of Jesus) and March 25 (the Feast of the Annunciation) were more common New Year\'s Days. The date varied significantly across different regions.' },

To correct this, Pope Gregory XIII introduced the Gregorian calendar in 1582. This reform re-established January 1 as New Year\'s Day. Protestant and Orthodox countries adopted the calendar much later; for example, Great Britain and its American colonies did not switch until 1752.' },

Modern celebrations are diverse, ranging from massive public gatherings like the ball drop in New York\'s Times Square (started in 1907) to quiet family traditions. The concept of making "New Year\'s resolutions" became widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries, rooted in ancient practices of making promises to the gods.' }

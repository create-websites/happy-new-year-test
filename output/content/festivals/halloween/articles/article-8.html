  <h2>Top haunted attractions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Asylum &amp; HotelÂ Fear:</strong> Located just outside the Strip, this dual haunted house is consistently ranked among the scariest in Nevada.  Guests navigate through chilling corridors populated by actors portraying deranged doctors and frantic patients.</li>
    <li><strong>Fright Dome (CircusÂ Circus):</strong> This annual event transforms the Adventuredome theme park into multiple haunted houses and scare zones.  Expect elaborate sets, live performers and intense scares.</li>
    <li><strong>ZakÂ Bagansâ€™ Haunted Museum:</strong> The host of <em>Ghost Adventures</em> curates rooms filled with allegedly cursed artifacts.  Guided tours provide chilling stories behind each itemâ€”an excellent daytime activity for paranormal enthusiasts.</li>
    <li><strong>EliÂ Rothâ€™s Goretorium (Seasonal):</strong> This attraction returns periodically for popâ€‘up runs.  It features gory scenes inspired by horror films and dark comedy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Themed shows and entertainment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cirque du Soleil Halloween specials:</strong> Some Cirque shows incorporate spooky elements during October, with performers in skeleton makeup and darker lighting design.</li>
    <li><strong>Magic and mindâ€‘reading shows:</strong> Renowned magicians like Criss Angel and Penn &amp; Teller often add Halloween flair to their acts.  Expect eerie stories and surprising twists.</li>
    <li><strong>Burlesque and cabaret:</strong> Shows like <em>Zumanity</em> and <em>Zombie Burlesque</em> combine comedy, horror and classic Vegas glamour.  Check age restrictions before attending.</li>
    <li><strong>Concerts and guest DJs:</strong> Major venues host oneâ€‘nightâ€‘only performances by popular artists.  Watch for Halloweenâ€‘themed sets where performers wear costumes and incorporate spooky visuals.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Parties and nightlife</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Stripâ€™s megaâ€‘clubs:</strong> Nightclubs such as Hakkasan, Omnia and XS host costume contests, celebrity DJ sets and elaborate decorations.  Secure tickets early as events sell out fast.</li>
    <li><strong>Downtown/Fremont Street Experience:</strong> The openâ€‘air party includes live music, costume parades and street performers.  Light shows and zipâ€‘line rides add to the spectacle.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotel parties:</strong> Resorts like the Cosmopolitan, Bellagio and Venetian host rooftop masquerades, poolside parties and themed bar crawls.</li>
    <li><strong>Adultâ€‘only events:</strong> For a more risquÃ© celebration, some venues offer vampire balls, fetish parties or immersive theater experiences for 21+ crowds.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Travel tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Book early:</strong> Hotels fill up quickly during Halloween week.  Look for package deals that include show tickets or club entry.</li>
    <li><strong>Costume rules:</strong> Casinos may restrict masks or props.  Check each venueâ€™s policies before arriving in costume.</li>
    <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Rideâ€‘shares are plentiful, but traffic on the Strip can be heavy.  Consider staying at a central hotel and walking to nearby events.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Desert weather and night of dancing can dehydrate you.  Drink plenty of water and plan breaks between events.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>With haunted houses that rival Hollywood sets and nightlife that stays spooky until dawn, LasÂ Vegas provides a Halloween experience like no other.  From pulseâ€‘pounding scares to glamorous parties, your October trip to the Entertainment Capital of the World will be unforgettable.</p>

This 11-day Babylonian festival re-enacted the creation myth, where the god Marduk defeats chaos. It involved purification rituals, parades, and a symbolic humiliation of the king to reaffirm his divinely sanctioned rule, establishing a powerful link between cosmic order, kingship, and societal renewal.`

A celebration of rebirth linked to the god Osiris, it included feasts, gift-giving, and a ritual where statues of gods were exposed to the sun to renew their divine power.`

Families eat "year-crossing noodles" to symbolize longevity and cutting away past hardships. The spiritual climax is *joya no kane*, a Buddhist ritual where temple bells are rung 108 times to cleanse the 108 worldly passions.`

                <p class="mb-4">Differing from the 1895 Nobel Prizes outlined by Alfred Nobel, the Economics prize began in 1968. Sweden's Riksbank, the central bank, established it to celebrate 300 years.  While financially independent, it emulated the originals in process and prestige, using the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to choose winners.</p>
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The "Pseudo-Nobel" Debate</h3>
                <p>The prize's origins sparked debate, even from Nobel's kin. His great-grandnephew saw it as mere "PR" for economists. The Nobel Foundation stresses it isn't a "Nobel Prize." Yet, its inclusion in the ceremony grants it global prestige, carefully constructed, not naturally earned.</p>

                    <p>Friedman's impact was transformative: his Nobel secured the Chicago School's dominance. He contested Keynesian economics, famously stating inflation's monetary roots. His book on US monetary history controversially reinterpreted the Great Depression. His ideas fueled the "Volcker Shock" and Thatcher's policies, prioritizing inflation control even if recessions followed.</p>

                    <p>Kahneman's prize, a landmark for psychology, reshaped economics. He blended psychological findings with economic models, contesting the idea of perfect human reason. With Tversky, he formulated Prospect Theory, showing how individuals assess outcomes via gains/losses and feel "loss aversion". This advanced behavioral economics, inspiring 'nudging' for policy, such as the UK's team subtly improving public services by altering 'choice architecture.'</p>

                    <p>Ostrom made history as the first woman to win the prize. A scholar of politics, she disputed the "Tragedy of the Commons." Fieldwork globally showed communities could manage resources without privatization or centralized control. She found essential "design principles" for sustainable, self-governing groups. Nepal's Community Forestry, handing forest control to locals, shows her ideas' impact, with environmental and economic gains.</p>

The data highlights a pronounced focus. Almost 50% of awards went to those from four US universities (Chicago, MIT, Harvard, Princeton).  Also, just three women have received the honor. This disparity raises concerns regarding selection bias, suggesting a closed system favoring established networks, with past winners often nominating associates and alumni.</p>

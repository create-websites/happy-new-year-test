<h2 class="section-title">More Than a Medal</h2>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">Annually, October brings the economic world to Stockholm, awaiting the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences. This Nobel Memorial Prize is the ultimate honor, marking the pinnacle of economic scholarship. Awarded since 1969, it reflects modern economics' progress, honoring pivotal advances that have transformed our comprehension of economics.</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed">This page examines the prize's twofold impact: acknowledging groundbreaking research while also controversially shaping the field. More than a simple acknowledgement of brilliance, it actively influences the discipline's internal dynamics and external standing.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The Making of a "Nobel"</h2>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">A Prize in Memory, Not by Bequest</h3>
<p class="mb-4">Differing from the 1895 Nobel Prizes outlined by Alfred Nobel, the Economics prize began in 1968. Sweden's Riksbank, the central bank, established it to celebrate 300 years.  While financially independent, it emulated the originals in process and prestige, using the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to choose winners.</p>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">The "Pseudo-Nobel" Debate</h3>
<p>The prize's origins sparked debate, even from Nobel's kin. His great-grandnephew saw it as mere "PR" for economists. The Nobel Foundation stresses it isn't a "Nobel Prize." Yet, its inclusion in the ceremony grants it global prestige, carefully constructed, not naturally earned.</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Key Laureates -->
<section class="mb-12" id="key-laureates">
<h2 class="section-title">A Pantheon of Economic Thought</h2>
<div class="space-y-8">
<!-- Milton Friedman -->
<div class="card">
<h3 class="laureate-name">Milton Friedman</h3>
<p class="laureate-year">1976 - The Monetarist Revolution</p>
<p>Friedman's impact was transformative: his Nobel secured the Chicago School's dominance. He contested Keynesian economics, famously stating inflation's monetary roots. His book on US monetary history controversially reinterpreted the Great Depression. His ideas fueled the "Volcker Shock" and Thatcher's policies, prioritizing inflation control even if recessions followed.</p>
</div>
<!-- Daniel Kahneman -->
<div class="card">
<h3 class="laureate-name">Daniel Kahneman</h3>
<p class="laureate-year">2002 - The Behavioral Turn</p>
<p>Kahneman's prize, a landmark for psychology, reshaped economics. He blended psychological findings with economic models, contesting the idea of perfect human reason. With Tversky, he formulated Prospect Theory, showing how individuals assess outcomes via gains/losses and feel "loss aversion". This advanced behavioral economics, inspiring 'nudging' for policy, such as the UK's team subtly improving public services by altering 'choice architecture.'</p>
</div>
<!-- Elinor Ostrom -->
<div class="card">
<h3 class="laureate-name">Elinor Ostrom</h3>
<p class="laureate-year">2009 - Governing the Commons</p>
<p>Ostrom made history as the first woman to win the prize. A scholar of politics, she disputed the "Tragedy of the Commons." Fieldwork globally showed communities could manage resources without privatization or centralized control. She found essential "design principles" for sustainable, self-governing groups. Nepal's Community Forestry, handing forest control to locals, shows her ideas' impact, with environmental and economic gains.</p>
</div>
<!-- 2025 Laureates -->
<div class="card">
<h3 class="laureate-name">Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion &amp; Peter Howitt</h3>
<p class="laureate-year"><a href="https://www.happy-new-year.org/2025/">2025</a> - The Frontier of Growth</p>
<p>This award underscored the prevailing view on sustained prosperity: growth spurred by innovation.  Mokyr's research linked continuous tech advancement to conducive social &amp; intellectual environments. Aghion and Howitt built upon Schumpeter's 'creative destruction,' framing growth as a disruptive cycle.  Their combined insights offer a strong fusion of history &amp; theory, portraying growth as a dynamic process driven by knowledge, culture, and economic competition.</p>

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-rose-700">Ideological Bias</h3>
<p>A key critique: the award disproportionately highlights neoclassical, free-market thinkers, neglecting critical voices from Marxist or Post-Keynesian schools. The absence of figures like Joan Robinson, coupled with strong representation from the Mont Pelerin Society, prompts charges of ideological bias.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-rose-700">An Exclusive Club</h3>
<p>Here's a rewritten version of similar length:

The data highlights a pronounced focus. Almost 50% of awards went to those from four US universities (Chicago, MIT, Harvard, Princeton).  Also, just three women have received the honor. This disparity raises concerns regarding selection bias, suggesting a closed system favoring established networks, with past winners often nominating associates and alumni.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">The Dual Legacy</h2>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">The Economics Prize mirrors modern economics, showcasing brilliant ideas, influential theories, and intense debate. It honors research that reshaped global policy, yet its impact is complex: born of controversy, shaped by bias, and fostering an exclusive elite.</p>
<p class="leading-relaxed">Here are a few rewritten options, maintaining a similar length and focus:

*   **The prize's evolution, tackling biases and expanding its scope, will signal the trajectory of economic thinking in this century.**

*   **How the prize evolves, confronting its limitations and embracing diversity, will define economic thought's 21st-century path.**

*   **A key measure of 21st-century economic thought's direction is whether the prize can overcome its biases and become more inclusive.**</p>
